# Climate Change
The essential goal of this paper was to figure out a way to calibrate a snow gauge effectively in preparation for the winter season. To optimize the calibration of the snow gauge, our team was given a data set that contained information on the Density as well as Gain readings over time.

For this project, my role was to look for and answer an additional hypothesis. The hypothesis that we chose to answer, is there a change in the overall climate? Using a larger data set containing information on Surface and Air temperature readings over time, we began by first cleaning up the data in R before conducting the initial analysis. With the cleaned data, we proceeded with our analysis by using a Holt-Winter's triple exponential smoothing model (Time Series Analysis) in R. The results then showed quite a marked difference in trends between years, and thus we were able to conclude that the climate was indeed changing.
