# Climate Change
The essential goal of this paper was to figure out a way to calibrate a snow gauge effectively in preparation for the winter season. To optimize the calibration of the snow gauge, our team was given a data set that contained information on the Density as well as Gain readings over time.

For this project, my role was to look for and answer an additional hypothesis. The hypothesis that we chose to answer, “How has climate change impacted the air and surface temperatures in the Arctic region?” Using a larger data set containing information on Surface and Air temperature readings over time, we began by first cleaning up the data in R before conducting the initial analysis. With the cleaned data, we proceeded with our analysis by using a Holt-Winter's triple exponential smoothing model (Time Series Analysis) in R. The results then showed an increasing pattern in the air and surface temperature trends between years, which illustrates an alarming upward impact of climate change in the Arctic region.
